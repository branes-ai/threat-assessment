Skeleton C++ program for an embodied AI system that processes multiple camera feeds and performs threat assessment. 

This skeleton provides a foundation for an embodied AI threat detection system with these key components:

1. **Camera Module**: Captures frames from multiple video sources in parallel
2. **Frame Processor**: Handles pre-processing of frames from all cameras
3. **Object Detector**: Uses a deep learning model to detect and classify objects
4. **Threat Assessor**: Analyzes detected objects and assigns threat scores
5. **System Controller**: Orchestrates the entire system and handles visualization

The system flow works like this:
- Multiple cameras capture video frames concurrently
- Frames are pre-processed and fed to the object detector
- Detected objects are analyzed by the threat assessment model
- High-threat objects trigger alerts with recommended actions
- Results are visualized with color-coded bounding boxes

To implement this in a real system, you would need to:
1. Supply your actual model files for object detection and threat assessment
2. Configure camera stream URLs
3. Potentially customize the threat scoring logic based on your specific requirements
4. Implement any hardware-specific interactions needed for your embodied platform
